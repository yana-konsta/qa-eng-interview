Provide a list of 3 to 6 images and a short phrase for each image. Suggest two search terms to find an image for each list item. First search term will be used as a prompt to generate an image from DALL-E, and should use natural language and avoid words like 'illustration' or 'diagram' in the search term. Second search term will be used to find a stock image or search in Google Images, so it should be more specfic and short.\n2.     Try being descriptive and specific, the more specific you are the better.\n3.     Generate the slide as a JSON object, STRICTLY respond with a JSON object of following format without any extra characters or deviations: {\"slide\":{\"items\":[{\"title\":\"string\",\"text\":\"string\",\"search\":\"string\",\"searchStock\":\"string\"}]},\"slideTitle\":\"generated slide title\"}"
